    on:blur={() => (answer = '')}>
    {#each questions as question}
      <option value={question.id}>{question.text}</option>
    {/each}

  <input bind:value={answer} />

  <button disabled={!answer} type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<p>selected question {selected ? selected : '[waiting...]'}</p>
<p>
  Because we haven't set an initial value of selected, the binding will set it
  to the default value (the first in the list) automatically. Be careful though
  â€” until the binding is initialised, selected remains undefined, so we can't
  blindly reference e.g. selected.id in the template.

<p>The documentation had</p>
<p>
  {@html marked('`<option value={question}>{question.text}</option>`')}
  but question is an object

  select multiple is also supported:
